### More Information


I started my climbing adventure one year ago, and currently can consistently climb **V5(6C+)** indoors. To me, climbing is less of a sport and more of a lifestyle to me. I've got bruises,scrapes, splits, but they never stop me from overcoming those boulder problems on the wall.  Itâ€™s the parallels between climbing and life that fascinate me. It provides me the chance to explore inwardly, to understand who I am, where my limits lie and how I can live more and become more. It doesn't help fix all wrongs in my life, but gives me the courage and resillience to face them in the future.
