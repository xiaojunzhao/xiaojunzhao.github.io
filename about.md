### More Information


I started my climbing adventure one year ago, and currently can consistently climb **V5(6C+)** indoors. To me, climbing is less of a sport and more of a lifestyle to me. I've got bruises,scrapes, splits and fear of falling, but it never stops me from overcoming those boulder problems on the wall.  It’s the parallels between climbing and life that fascinate me. It provides me the chance to explore inwardly, to understand who I am, where my limits lie and how I can live more and become more. It doesn't help fix all wrongs in my life, but gives me the drive and resillience to face them in the future.
