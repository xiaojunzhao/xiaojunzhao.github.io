I'm currently a **Data Scientist** at the research center of **United Technologies Corporation (UTC)** with a background in computational geometry. I have over 4 years of extensive quantitative research/data science experience in various areas, such as Predictive Analysis, Prognostics Health & Monitoring, Cybersecurity, Natural Language Processing, etc, with a proven track record of developing and implementing statistical/machine learning algorithms that have significantly impacted business revenues, and solve a variety of real world industry problems. 

### More Information


I've been climbing since Feb 2018, and currently can consistently climb **V5(6C+)** indoors. 
It’s the parallels between climbing and life that fascinate me. The chance to explore inwardly, to understand who I am, where my limits lie and how I can live more and become more. Every day is a school day and I learn something new. There is no success or failure, it’s about trying and learning.
