**After-Market Pricing Analytics of Engine Maintenance Costs** (Pratt & Whitney)
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The project is funded by Pratt& Whitney, and aims to provide accurate engine maintenance cost estimation for each coming year. In the project, I built and maintained the data warehouse (Parquet) of 5+ years of shop visiting records containing 150,000+ engine  parts using data ETL (extract, transform, load) process. A novel predictive model is developed and validated for billion dollar V2500 portfolio managed by P&W Engine Services organization, and provided significance performance uplift in reducing the prediction error of the engine maintenance cost by 90%. To reduce the redundancy time in model execution, I spearheaded the development of the end-to-end data pipeline and operationalized by the P&W after 2017Q1.</p>

**COntinuous Monitoring of Behavior to protect devices from evolving mobile Application Threats**
(Department of Homeland Security Research Project)

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This project is funded by DHS ($1.45 million) focuses on detecting Android Malware detect malicious and vulnerable apps of varying risk severity levels. We differ from existing projects by training adversarial deep learning model over 3+ million mobile applications to accurately (~94.6%) classify samples built with majority of benign code and less malicious code. We were also able to produced a detailed risk-assessment report that includes an explanation of why an app is considered malicious using the LIME Analysis (Local interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations). This project is currently in progress, and expected to have an initial version of the software released by 2019. </p>

**Gear Turbofan(GTF) Engine Lift-off Seal Prognostics and Health Monitoring** (Pratt & Whitney)
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The project aims to identify the main factors for the Lift-off seal failure in Gear Turbofan Engine (one of the most advanced and efficient aircraft engine recently developed by Pratt& Whitney). In this project, I constructed the data curation pipeline by incorporating internal engine performance report,external flightaware(i.e. flight history) information and nasa airquality data, and perform data cleansing during the process. In addition, new features are engineered, such as cruise time, take off duration, landing duration,etc from the curated database, and most revelant features are selected based on the feature selection analysis. At last, we designed and implemented a sliding window based machine leanring model with the operationalizable accuracy.</p>

**Learned 3D Shape Descriptors for Classifying 3D Point Cloud Models** (Research Thesis)
<p style='text-align: justify;'> This is my research thesis funded by my advisor Dr. Horea, Ilies, Uconn. we focus on the task of classifying 3D point clouds captured with commercial 3D cameras, and we integrate supervised machine learning algorithms with three different shape descriptors, namely Light-Field Descriptors, Angular Radial Transform (ART), and Zernike Descriptors (ZD). We evaluate the classification performance for different machine learning algorithms combined with these different shape descriptors on models downloaded from the Google 3D Warehouse, and we demonstrate good performance in automatically classifying practical point cloud models. Furthermore, we show that Zernike Descriptors are practically insensitive to noises typically found in point cloud models captured via 3D sensing.</p>
